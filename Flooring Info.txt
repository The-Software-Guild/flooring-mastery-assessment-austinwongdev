Orders_06012013.txt is a sample file which is included in the sample download above.

Some of the order fields are calculations:

    MaterialCost = (Area * CostPerSquareFoot)
    LaborCost = (Area * LaborCostPerSquareFoot)
    Tax = (MaterialCost + LaborCost) * (TaxRate/100)
        Tax rates are stored as whole numbers
    Total = (MaterialCost + LaborCost + Tax)
